          Micheal Scott: former manager of the Dunder Miflin Scranton branch
        </p>
        <p id="tribute-info">
          Michael Gary Scott is a fictional character on NBC's The Office,
          portrayed by Steve Carell and based on David Brent from the British
          version of the program. Michael is the central character of the
          series, serving as the Regional Manager of the Scranton branch of a
          paper distribution company, known as Dunder Mifflin Inc. from seasons
          1â€“7. <br> <br> However, he temporarily leaves Dunder Mifflin to form the Michael
          Scott Paper Company with Pam Beesly and Ryan Howard toward the end of
          the 5th season and shares a co-managerial position with Jim Halpert
          during a 6th season arc from "The Meeting" to "The Manager and the
          Salesman". In the end of the 7th season, he proposes to HR
          representative Holly Flax and moves to Colorado to take care of her
          aging parents, leaving the manager position to Deangelo Vickers in
          "Goodbye, Michael", to Andy Bernard in season 8, after Vickers becomes
          brain dead, and ultimately to Dwight Schrute in season 9.
